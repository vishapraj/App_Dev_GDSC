# App_Dev_GDSC

# Overview of Project
This project is designed to guide us through the exploration and hands-on learning of Flutter and Dart, the powerful frameworks for building cross-platform mobile applications. We will start with the installation of the necessary tools, explore the basics of Dart and Flutter, build their first Flutter app, and delve into advanced topics such as Material Design, networking, state management, using plugins, and testing.

# Introduction to Dart
Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It's designed for building mobile, web, server, and desktop applications. Dart was created with a focus on productivity, performance, and flexibility. Here's an introduction to some of the key aspects of Dart:

Features of Dart:
Object-Oriented Language:

Dart is an object-oriented language, which means it supports classes and objects, inheritance, interfaces, and other features typical of object-oriented programming.
Strongly Typed:

Dart supports static type checking, where types can be explicitly declared for variables. However, it also has type inference, allowing the omission of explicit type annotations in many cases.
Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:

Dart can be compiled using both JIT and AOT compilation. JIT compilation enables fast development cycles with features like hot reload in Flutter for quick code changes. AOT compilation results in highly optimized, standalone executables suitable for production deployments.
Garbage Collection:

Dart has automatic memory management through garbage collection. It handles memory allocation and deallocation, allowing developers to focus on writing code without managing memory explicitly.
Asynchronous Programming:

Dart provides built-in support for asynchronous programming using async and await keywords. This allows developers to write non-blocking code, making it easier to work with operations like I/O, network requests, and more.
Flutter Framework:

Dart is prominently known as the language used for developing applications using the Flutter framework. Flutter enables the creation of cross-platform mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop applications from a single codebase.
